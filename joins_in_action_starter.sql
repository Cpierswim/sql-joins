-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< EXAMPLE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Do a full outer join to see all records from both tables matched where possible.
-- EXPECTED RESULT: 77 Rows Returned

SELECT * FROM movies;
select * from users;

-- Because MySQL does not support "OUTER JOIN" syntax, we must use left and right joins that are brought together with "UNION".

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Do a left join to see all records from the movies table and matching records from the users table.
-- EXPECTED RESULT: 75 Rows Returned

	select * from movies left join users on users.favorite_movie_id = movies.movie_id;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Do a right join to see all records from the users table and matching records from the movies table.
-- EXPECTED RESULT: 16 Rows Returned

    select * from movies right join users on movies.movie_id = users.favorite_movie_id;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Do a inner join to get only the rows from the movies tables that have matching rows in the users tables.
-- EXPECTED RESULT: 14 Rows Returned

	select * from users inner join movies on users.favorite_movie_id = movies.movie_id;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 4 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Determine which lead studio's movies are favorited by users the most.
-- EXPECTED RESULT: Disney

	select movies.lead_studio from users inner join movies on users.favorite_movie_id = movies.movie_id 
    group by movies.lead_studio order by count(movies.lead_studio) desc limit 1;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Get the average Rotten Tomatoes score of all movies that are favorited by a user.
-- EXPECTED RESULT: 52.21

	select round(avg(movies.rotten_tomatoes), 2) from users inner join movies on users.favorite_movie_id = movies.movie_id; 

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 6 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Determine which two movies are have duplicate entries in the dataset. (HINT: No join is needed for this problem)
-- EXPECTED RESULT: Mamma Mia!, Gnomeo and Juliet
-- It is important to be able to identify dirty data within a dataset!

	select movies.film from movies group by movies.film HAVING count(movies.film) > 1;
